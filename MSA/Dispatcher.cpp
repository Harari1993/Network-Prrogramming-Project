// Lab 9
// The server will open a TCP server socket and start listening for
// incoming connections from clients.
// 2. Once a connection with a client is established and a new peer socket is
// created the peer socket is added to a container of peers sockets which
// are managed by the “Dispatcher”.
// 3. The Dispatcher is a new class that listen to all peers and handle the
// incoming commands from the peers.
// 4. At this stage you need to implement all the commands up to sending
// messages between peers.
