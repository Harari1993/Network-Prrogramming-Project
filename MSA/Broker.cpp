//1. The Broker is a new class you need to create that manages an open
//   session between two peers.
//2. Once two peers start a session a new Broker object is created with the
//   two peers.
//3. The Broker reads the incoming commands and messages from the
//   peers and perform the required operations according to the incoming
//   commands.
//4. Once the session between the two peers is ended, the peers are
//   returned to the Dispatcher and the Broker is deleted.
